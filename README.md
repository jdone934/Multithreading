#Problem Explanation
Problem explanation was taken from scenario 3 at [this location](https://www.cs.waikato.ac.nz/~tcs/tmp/thething.html)

To summarize, I am simulating a Roller Coaster at an amusement park. The roller coaster has 2 cars that can each hold 4 passengers. There are 10 passengers in the park. When a car is full, it is able to go on the ride (which lasts 12) seconds. A car cannot leave until 4 seconds after the previous car has left. When a car is finished with the ride, the passengers leave, and wait a random amount of time (between 0 and 5 seconds) before joining the queue again. We then count how many people completed the ride after 120 seconds of simulations.# Multithreading
